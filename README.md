Heartbreaker RPG Character Generator
Heartbreaker is a tabletop RPG derived and inspired from my favorite parts of various Open Source content including The Black Hack by David Black, the world's most famous RPG by Gary Gygax and David Arneson and various other OSR retroclones and simulacrum including OSE.
